# Scout24

This example shows form processing and form helper handling in Play.
## Requirements
* SBT: [simple build tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* Java 8 or higher.

## How to run
Clone this repo and `cd` into it.

Start the Play app:

```bash
sbt run
```

And open <http://localhost:9000/>

## Play framework

Play Framework is new to me. I have used it, because it's easy and also provides some Scala compatibility

Also, I used Jsoup for the first time which scrape and parse HTML

## As for limitations:
I still need to check for redirectories as well as better exception handling for whether the url is typed correctly and show proper error message
The output and the application also needs to be formatted in a better way.. I am also relativly not very experienced in web development so I did what I could do in order to produce results
